        res.csv([
            ['foo', 'bar', null, 'mock'],
            ['1', '2', undefined, '3']
        ])
    });
```

    RESPONSE
		hearders:
			{ 'x-powered-by': 'Express',
              'content-type': 'text/csv; charset=utf-8',
              'content-disposition': 'attachment; filename=export.csv',
              'content-length': '$LENGTH',
              etag: 'W/"8-c57db25c"',
              date: 'Sun, 21 Dec 2014 03:41:14 GMT',
              connection: 'close' 
            }
        text:
            foo, bar, , mock
            1, 2, , 3       

Also, you can pass an array of objects to be serialized, in which case the object's properties will be iterated over.  E.g.:

```js
    res.csv([
        {
            SN: 000001,
            Major:0001,
            Minor: 0001
        },{
            SN: 000002,
            Major:0002,
            Minor: 0002 
        }
    ])
//=> 000001, 0001, 0001
//=> 000002, 0002, 0002

```
